#### INTRODUCTION
Housing in India varies from palaces toplaces, in big cities to tiny huts in far-flung villages. There has been tremendous growth in India's housing sector as incomes have risen.
Renting, also known as hiring or letting, is an agreement where a payment is made for the temporary use of a good, service, or property owned by another.
A gross lease is when the tenant pays a flat rental amount and the landlord pays for all property charges regularly incurred by the ownership. Renting can be an example of the sharing economy.
#### CONTENT
In this Dataset, we have information on almost 4700+ Houses/Apartments/Flats Available for Rent with different parameters like BHK, Rent, Size, No. of Floors, Area Type, Area Locality, City, Furnishing Status, Type of Tenant Preferred, No. of Bathrooms, Point of Contact.
#### Used technique
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
sklearn
logistic Regression model
#### Aim
Trying to predict the point of contact according with other features here
11 features are here and they all considered as independed variable using these data tring to predict the dependant variable point of contact.
predicting the accuracy of the model
predicting relationship between predicted value and actual value

#### Analysis
using 11 features according to house rental data predicting the values of point of contact
point of contact feature considered as dependent(y)variable
All other features used as independent variables(x)
Deleted unwanted featers
Renamed some features to better analysis
Predicted the value after split the train test data
Consider the 80 percent train data and remainin 20 percent test data
The model have 84 percent
The model predicted 84 percent accuracy

#### conclusion
Conclusion
The model have 84 percentage accuracy
The accuracy means 84 percentage predicted values are same as the original value
